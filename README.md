The official Android and iOS companion app to the Borefts Beer Festival 2020, as organised yearly by brewery De Molen. For everything on the festival itself, please visit [the offical festival website](http://brouwerijdemolen.nl/borefts-bierfestival/).

This app was build by [Eric Kok](http://ekok.nl) of [2312 development](http://2312.nl) from scratch this year in Flutter. For the 2013-2019 Android apps see [erickok/borefts2015](https://github.com/erickok/borefts2015/blob/master/README.md). We are open-source, so free to contribute or to modify for your own (festival) needs. Remember, though, the GNU GPLv3 license is copyleft, so every single change or addition needs to be open-sourced under the same license.
